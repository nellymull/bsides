          <div class="detail-box">
            <p class="detail">Hello, I am Pete Rucys, CISO for Tampa General Hospital, driven by curiosity, due diligence, and continuous education. I started my career in IT after serving in the US Air Force, where the area of Information Assurance was beginning to gain ground and grab my attention. While living in Chicago, I worked for American National Can, Axiom, and RR Donnelly & Sons as a network engineer. The focus of security in organizations at the time was in its infancy, because of this I was able to learn how important core security principles were vital to doing business and how real the threats were. I migrated to Tampa, FL; employed by JP Morgan and eventually the Air Force, again, in the capacity of a Computer Network Defense Manager. There it became real, very quickly. I was able to visually see the threats, visualize the big picture of security, and learn from some of the best our country has to offer. I brought these tools to Tampa General Hospital, hired as the first dedicated network security engineer the organization has ever had. Through supportive leadership, my predecessor and I were able to start a security program from the ground up, implementing controls I had learned from my previous employments. Not only is this program protecting the hospital, it is protecting a community that is dependent on the expert care that TGH provides. The satisfaction that I receive from my work that is protecting one of the largest hospitals in Florida is immeasurable.
