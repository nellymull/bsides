Learn about the world of biohacking while getting some hands-on experience with transcranial Direct Current Stimulation &#40;tDCS&#41; devices that will allow you to take power over your own brain patterns through safe electrical stimulation. A limited number of kits will be available for you take home and solder (instructions provided) so that you too can empower yourself with brain stimulation-based biohacking. We will also have other biohacking products and information to share, ranging from CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing to medical device security. If you’re a tinkerer, maker, hacker, or breaker, then you won't want to miss this opportunity. For the best possible experience, bring your soldering iron and materials, and an open mind, and see how the world of biohacking can help you hack your way to better living and a new security mindset. As part of the biohacking group, Vagabond Banana, Jen and Darren have explored topics ranging from quantified-self, nootropics, implants, genomics, sensory augmentation, and neurostimulation. Together, they have presented material covering biohacking basics, personal genomics, and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation at multiple conferences including DEFCON, BDYHAX, and BSides.
